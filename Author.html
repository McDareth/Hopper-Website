                        A. B. Augustin is an electrical engineer, computer scientist, systems engineering doctoral candidate, and manager with the federal government. Beyond all this, 
                        she has always considered her primary role to be that of a mother. 
                        </p><p>
                        One of her desires when her two sons, Nigel and Miles, were in grade school was to author a children’s book. 
                        Well, these two young men are twentysomething millennials now, and at last, that dream has come to fruition.

                        What God has for you is for you. If God has purposed a desire in your heart, 
                        don’t give up. Continue to pursue it; you may very well be delayed but not denied. To God by the glory!
